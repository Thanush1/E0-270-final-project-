On running 'trained_models.py', saved models of all 3 variants of RBMs are run on both fashion mnist and mnist dataset and they print the accuracy in each case. 
'Classification_RBMs_on_MNIST.ipynb' is the jupyter notebook for the all the classification RBMs on MNIST dataset. Comments are written at appropriate places which guide on running specific variant of the RBM. 
'Classification_RBMs_on_fashion_MNIST.ipynb' is the jupyter notebook for the all the classification RBMs on fashion MNIST dataset.Comments are written at appropriate places which guide on running speciic variant of the  RBM. 
'Discriminative_RBM__MNIST.sav' - saved model of Discriminative RBM on MNIST dataset 
'Generative_RBM__MNIST.sav' - saved model of Generative RBM on MNIST dataset 
'Hybrid_RBM__MNIST.sav' - saved model of Hybrid RBM on MNIST dataset 
'Discriminative_RBM_fashion_MNIST.sav' - saved model of Discriminative RBM on fashion MNIST dataset 
'Generative_RBM_fashion_MNIST.sav' - saved model of Generative RBM on fashion MNIST dataset
